"""
For our tutorial we are going to configure our Item Loader to:

- Remove the Â£ sign from the data we're scraping.
- Convert the scraped relative urls to full absolute urls.

We do this by using Scrapy itemloaders (preprocessors). Additionally, we'll be using pipelines to process the data before exporting by completing the below tasks:

- Convert the price from a string to a float (so we can then multiply it by the exchange rate).
- Convert the price from British Pounds to US Dollars
- Drop items that currently have no price (due to being sold out).
- Check if an Item is a duplicate and drop it if it's a duplicate.
